# Index maps

This is a minimal repo adapted from [openui5-sample-app](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app)
to generate javascript bundle file that uses index source maps (aka sectioned maps).

# Instructions
* Add or modifiy files inside the `webapp` folder
* Run `npm run build`
* The bundle file and its indexed sourcemap will be located at `dist/resources` (all other dist files can be ignored)
* Load the `bundle.js` file in a browser for testing
